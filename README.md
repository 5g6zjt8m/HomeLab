# HomeLab

I've found that having a complex tech environment at home is a key way to accelerate learning. Importantly, having home servers and networking configurations helps expose me to aspects of these systems that would be hard to come by in typical professional environments.

## What is this?

I wanted to have an organized repository for changes and configurations that I make in my homelab.

This repository is designed with dated log entries, as my home setup is (slowly) ever-evolving. I build for stability, so I rarely _need_ to make changes or perform critical maintenance. This means that there may be large lengths of time between entries. Upon creating this repository, my goal will be to add something semi-substantial here every couple of months.
