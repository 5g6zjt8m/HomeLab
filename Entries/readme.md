## [2024-5-2-Prefacing](/Entries/2024-5-2_Prefacing/)

This is giving context to all future entries as to where my homelab sits as of 5/2/2024.

Around eight months ago, I embarked on upgrading my homelab setup, moving from a basic ISP router to a more configurable network and a modular workstation. I switched to a new router, got a Lenovo laptop, and set up a Synology NAS. After transitioning my old desktop into a virtualization server, I encountered issues with Windows on the new laptop, leading me to switch to Ubuntu. However, I later realized Ubuntu couldn't run Fusion 360 for my CAD projects. I decided to set up a dual boot system but faced networking issues with the hypervisor during the process. My plan now is to back up VMs, sell the current server, and build a purpose-built virtualization server.
